# ChivesBot Public Roadmap

This repository is [ChivesBot](https://chivesbot.com)'s public feature roadmap.

## About

ChivesBot is a GitHub + Slack app that brings you relevant notifications from GitHub in Slack.

We got frustrated with GitHub's official Slack integration.

It's unmaintained. Feature requests have been open for years with plenty of upvotes, but there hasn't been any love from GitHub.

Why can't you create Slack notifications for only deployments to production?

Why can't you mute pull-request notifications that were created by bots such as Dependabot?

We're building something better.

At its core, we want more flexibility when creating notifications than the official integration.
